<!--* HTML ENTITIES  
<!-- *---------------------------------------- -->
<!--?  HTML entities are codes used to represent special characters and symbols that have reserved meanings in HTML. 
<!--?  These entities are especially important when you  want to display characters that might conflict with HTML syntax or 
<!--?  when you want to display characters that aren't directly available on your keyboard. 
<!--?  HTML entities are represented using an ampersand (&) followed by a code and a semicolon (;). -->
